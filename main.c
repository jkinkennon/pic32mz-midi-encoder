/*******************************************************************************
  MPLAB Harmony Project Main Source File

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.
  
  File Name:
    main.c

  Summary:
    This file contains the "main" function for an MPLAB Harmony project.

  Description:
    This file contains the "main" function for an MPLAB Harmony project.  The
    "main" function calls the "SYS_Initialize" function to initialize the state 
    machines of all MPLAB Harmony modules in the system and it calls the 
    "SYS_Tasks" function from within a system-wide "super" loop to maintain 
    their correct operation. These two functions are implemented in 
    configuration-specific files (usually "system_init.c" and "system_tasks.c")
    in a configuration-specific folder under the "src/system_config" folder 
    within this project's top-level folder.  An MPLAB Harmony project may have
    more than one configuration, each contained within it's own folder under
    the "system_config" folder.
